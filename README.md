# ðŸ˜• Introduction

If you're familiar with Laravel, then you should be familiar with _artisan inspire_. 
It's a simple command that outputs an inspirational quote when you run it.

I thought it would be fun to build the opposite of that command. A command
that when ran, spits out a humourous uninspiring quote. 

## Usage

```bash
php artisan uninspire
```

to share, feel free to submit a Pull Request!
